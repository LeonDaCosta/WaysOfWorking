# Ways Of Working

This is a collection of ideas and advice which exists to detail the most ideal and realistic ways of working 
in a small web development team and may or may not align to your ideas. The information should be relevant irrespective
of your chosen workflow (agile/waterfall, etc). 

The purpose of this information is purely because following publicly produced standards are a great idea on paper but in practise
they either don't work in their entirety or they don't cover anything other than code syntax.

Some ideas here may have the potential to be based purely on the personal opinion of the author/s and would not correctly reflect the opinions of 
Precision Proco Group. If you think that is the case please choose to ignore it. Take from these ideas what you believe would 
work for you or your organisation.

Although some rules in this repo may be also be fully or partially covered by standards in PHP-FIG, it is important to 
re-iterate and explain some things as the importance of some of these rules can often be overlooked, and the rule 
ignored.

>NOTE: The information in this repo assumes that somebody is looking to implement ways of working and processes into their own development
team or project and do not already have one in place.
