## Use Design Patterns that solve your problem or improve re-usability

Design patterns should be used when appropriate and they should solve a problem or make your code more re-usable.
Common design patterns and methodologies that are recommended to employ for web development are as follows

- DDD (Domain Driven Design)
- ADR (Action Domain Response)
- TDD (Test Driven Tesign)
- Factory Pattern
- Adapter Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Observer Pattern
